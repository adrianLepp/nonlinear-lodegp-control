# nonlinear_lodegp_control

This project is based on the [LODE-GP](https://github.com/ABesginow/LODE-GPs) and was developed in my master thesis
*Physics-informed Gaussian Process Regression: Applications in Modelling and Control of Nonlinear Systems*.


## Requirements

For installation run 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adrianLepp/nonlinear-lodegp-control.git
pip install -e ./nonlinear-lodegp-control
```


SageMath (https://www.sagemath.org/) needs to be installed seperately:

```bash
# Example install via conda (recommended):
conda install -c conda-forge 
```
